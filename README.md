# Welcome!
You have found my portfolio. Each subdirectory in this repository represents a discrete project, and has its own README to introduce the project, any key takeaways, and document some important decisions. Each project is either a generic version of something I've actually built for a profit-driven endeavour, a clone of an existing well-known product or service that I've built for fun (usually denoted by `-clone` in the project name), or a project representing a single concept or pattern that I use frequently or want to showcase.

### A Word of Warning
All of the _projects_ (that is, not the reference architectures, but the full-blown projects) in this portfolio have been entirely built by myself to the extent that _anything_ in this world is built entirely by one person, which is a philosophical discussion that I won't get into here. That means that the majority of the work has been done on things related solution architecture, scalability, fault-tolerance, cost-optimization, data resilience, etc. Web development is __not__ the focus of my career, and that idea is reflected here. Systems that require a UI have a UI developed only to the extent that they can showcase functionality of workloads and _no futher_. This is on purpose. Thanks for reading!
